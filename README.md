# Gravitational Lensing
A scientific computing project for imaging galaxy clusters after being transformed by gravitational lensing. 
In the presence of a massive object, the curvurture of space causes the rays of light to bend. This bending is particularly interesting in the presence of a massive dark matter object. The object causing the bend in space cannot be seen, however the object (e.g. galaxy clusters) behind the massive object will form an Einstein ring. The equation for the transformation is one-to-many and a purely analytical approach was not possible. As a result an iteration of each row and column was required to simulate the Einstien Rings. 

First the code was used for low dimensional objects with a simple population in the centre of the image for a 10x10 pixel.
The resolution then continually increases up to 4000x4000 with more complicated galaxy cluster simulations. The untransformed galaxy cluster was simulated to be probabilistic, with the chance of a galaxy populating decreasing as the radius increased. This reflected a more accurate and realistic situation of how a galaxy cluster may look like in the presence of an invisible dark matter matter object obscuring the rays of light.
